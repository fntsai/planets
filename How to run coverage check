## This is the steps for running the script that is used to check genomic coverage
GO TO "https://sourceforge.net/projects/rseqc/files/BED/Mouse_Mus_musculus/" to download "mm10_UCSC_knownGene.bed.gz"
Unzip "mm10_UCSC_knownGene.bed.gz" and put it in your Bam file
There are 2 ways that you can run coverage
You can run it for each file, using the script "20170414.bed.for.coverage.sh". It is stored in "planets/POP3".
Put it in the bam file.
On Terminal, go to your bam folder. Type "MSUB scipt.txt" to submit the job.
Or you can use the script that generates script for all of the samples at once. This is script stored in "planets/POP3", called
"1.scriptloop_htseq_genebody.py"
You can run this locally. On terminal, you type "python script.py"
You will see all of the ".sh" files corresponding to the sample name of each sample in your Bam folder
To submit the samples to quest, use "submit.genebody.txt". Put this to the Bam folder.
On terminal, type "MSUB script.txt"
